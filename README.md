# horiseon2

This week's project involves refactor an exsisting code for the Horiseon Company's website. My main objectives were to make the html and css files more semantic as well as ensuring proper functionality by testing enbeded links. 

The exsisiting original code I was tasked with refracting was located at git@github.com:coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram.git.

The link has the mock-up provided.
